    <h1>Albert Einstein</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> <strong>Albert Einstein</strong> (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity,
        one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is <br> also known for its influence on the philosophy
        of science. He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". <br>
        He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect",
        a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.</p>
        <p>Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with
            the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his <br> special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902–1909),
            Switzerland. However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields, and he published <br> a paper on general relativity
            in 1916 with his theory of gravitation. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle
            theory and the motion of <br> molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, he 
            applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.</p>
            <p>He lived in Switzerland between 1895 and 1914, except for one year in Prague, and he received his academic diploma from the Swiss federal polytechnic 
                school (later the Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) <br> in Zürich in 1900. He taught theoretical physics there between 1912 and 1914 before he 
                left for Berlin. He acquired Swiss citizenship in 1901, which he kept for the rest of his life after being stateless for more than five <br> years. 
                In 1905, he was awarded a PhD by the University of Zurich. The same year, he published four groundbreaking papers during his renowned annus 
                mirabilis (miracle year) which brought him to the notice of the <br> academic world at the age of 26.

                <h2>Early life and education</h2>
<p>Einstein always excelled at maths and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers. The twelve year old Einstein
   <strong>taught himself</strong> algebra and Euclidean geometry over a single <br> summer. Einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the Pythagorean
    theorem at age 12.</p>
<h3><pre><p><b>      A family tutor Max Talmud said: "<em>after I had given the 12 year old Einstein a geometry textbook, after a short time he had worked through the whole book."</em></b></p></pre></h3>
<p>He thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics... Soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high I could not follow." His passion for geometry and algebra
    led the twelve year old to become convinced that <br> nature could be understood as a "mathematical structure". Einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as 
    a 14 year old he says he had "mastered integral and differential calculus".</p>
